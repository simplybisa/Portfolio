            I've always been someone who enjoys understanding how things work — from building PCs to solving network issues. My technical journey started with curiosity and turned into a passion through school and my current internship as an IT technician.

            I enjoy working on real problems, helping others with tech, and learning by doing. At school, I'm focused on practical IT skills like hardware maintenance, basic networking, and web development. Every project or task is a new chance to improve.

            Outside the screen, I'm also really into cars — I love reading about engines, modifications, and the latest automotive tech. It's a totally different world, but one that fuels my curiosity just the same.

            Right now, I'm exploring different areas of IT to see where I want to specialize in the future. Whether it's cybersecurity, system administration, or something entirely unexpected — I'm excited for what's ahead.
